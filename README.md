# Blog word-count scraper

A little script to run on [now](https://zeit.co/now) to count the words on my blog and post them to my published
word-count beeminder goal

This is most likely only useful at all to me

It's also pretty gross - but that's alright, it just does the one tiny thing.

Glue and that
